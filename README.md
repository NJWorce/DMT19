# DMT19
This is the Real-DMT_2019's repo for the dare mighty things hackathon 2019

For this project our team focused on a natural language processing computer interaction program using Javascript, CSS, HTML 5, Bootstrap, Google Cloud Services, and Google's DialogFlow framework. 

This project is an advanced proof of concept solving the problem of consumer care and QA with a virtual assistant. 

Through dialog users can specify their interest in a type of beauty product, the simulated assistant will then ask follow-up questions and make suggestions depending on skin type, allergies, etc. 

This product is still under development, with the vision being to incorporate web scraping for advanced ingredient retrieval as well as utilizing Google's AppEngine API to allow for scalability and efficient resource management.
